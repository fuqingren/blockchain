# School transcripts & Adding companies by student

The transcript creation network allows schools create students' transcript by submitting the transaction "ModifyTranscript", and the asset 
Transcript will be created by school. Moreover, other than the "ModifyByStudent" transaction, students are allowed to add/remove
companies to view their transcripts.


# Newwork Flow
The Business network flow is the following:

1. School participant creates an asset Transcript by submitting a transaction "ModifyTranscript".

2. Students as participants are able to add or remove companies on their list list for  job applications, by submitting the transaction
"ModifyByStudent"

# Participant
